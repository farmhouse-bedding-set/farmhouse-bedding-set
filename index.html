    <h1>3 WAYS TO KEEP YOUR BEDDING FRESH AND CLEAN</h1>

    <div class="container">

        <p>Cleaning bedding is one of the best ways to protect the health of the whole family. In a time when the Covid-19 epidemic is having complicated developments like today, an unclean bed can also be a factor in helping the virus to stick and enter the human body. Washing also makes keeping your <a href="https://geembi.com/collections/lifestyle/farmhouse/">farmhouse bedding set</a> clean and safe for the health of you and your family.</p>

        <h2>WASH BEDDING PERIODICALLY</h2>

        <p>Washing bedding is one of the most time-consuming household chores. It's no surprise that many of us tend to leave it on a little longer, especially when our linens "do not look dirty". But just because you can't see the dust particles and bacteria, doesn't mean they aren't there. And chances are you don't make your bed as often as you should.</p>
        <p>Experts say you should wash all your bed sheets, duvet covers, pillowcases, and mattress covers once a week. This may sound like a lot, but we all know how quickly bacteria can grow and multiply in unwashed sheets. There are a lot of germs and bacteria that accumulate in a short period of time. Bacterial buildup in bed is largely due to sweat, body oils, and dead cells (which attract dust mites) that stick from your body onto the sheets while you sleep.</p>
        <p>The study found that the distribution of bacteria on pillowcases was slightly lower than on bed sheets, but not by much. We tend to wash our faces more often than our bodies, but products like moisturizers and other nighttime skin care products also build up quickly on pillowcases. This encourages the growth of germs right on the pillow.</p>
        <p>In fact, you may find that changing your pillowcase more than once a week helps control oily skin and breakouts. So if you have acne, you should change your pillowcase regularly to limit its growth.</p>
        <p>According to the recommendations of medical experts on health care, we should clean bedding periodically every 2-3 months. However, during the covid season, you should change and wash them more than twice a month.</p>
        <p>This helps prevent germs that can breed in bed sheets, pillowcases, and duvet covers, as well as preventing the accumulation of house dust mites, their droppings, and the dead skin they feed on. In fact, a bedroom is an ideal place for dust mites to breed and thrive. Beds, carpets, and mattresses all trapped moisture, allowing these little bugs to breed.</p>
        <p>However, you can absolutely make sure your bed is free of dust mites by Buying a hypoallergenic cover with a zipper to cover your mattress, platform, and pillow. Wash sheets, pillowcases, blankets, and mattress covers in hot water at least once a week. Dry them in natural sunlight or machine dry them.</p>
        <p>If you are a person with sensitive skin, the more you need to keep your bed clean. On average, we lie in bed for 7-8 hours a day, so our body is in direct contact with blankets and sheets. Dirty sheets help bacteria and dust mites accumulate for a long time, causing allergy symptoms.</p>
        <p>When we are allergic to dust mites, we often mistakenly think that we are allergic to weather, so we should buy medicine to drink. Dust mite allergies in people with asthma often cause severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, shortness of breath, chest pain, and severe asthma attacks. If you're prone to allergies or asthma, it's best to change your bed sheets more than once a week, to minimize dust and dust mites.</p>
        <p>Therefore, regular cleaning of beddings and pillows is extremely important, not only to help keep the room clean and beautiful but also to maximize health. Even so, a survey by the Sleep Council found that about a quarter of us tend to change our sheets only once a month.</p>

        <h2>DO NOT EAT OR DRINK IN BED</h2>

        <p>With the emergence of more and more TV shows and movies, even without a TV, you can watch them with your phone or computer. Watching a movie in bed is becoming an increasingly common habit. And of course, no movie session is complete without a snack.</p>
        <p>But what are the effects of eating in bed? Eating in bed can create an unsanitary bedroom space. Most of us know that dishes should be washed after eating. But in many cases, because of being lazy or absorbed in an attractive movie, after eating in bed, you forget to wash your dishes. Or simply leave them on until you get to the kitchen next time - maybe the next morning! That leaves a lot of time for germs and bacteria to grow and cause unsanitary bed areas.</p>
        <p>Leave debris and even the tiniest bits of food that can attract ants and cockroaches to crawl onto your bed. While you may think you've been careful and avoided dropping any food on the sheets, cockroaches, and ants only need a small amount of food to survive, so it's better if you don't leave your food alone. Drinking water fell on the bed.</p>
        <p>Keeping your sheets and mattress clean isn't easy, especially if you eat in bed every day. We must change bed sheets regularly to avoid bacteria breeding in the sleeping space.</p>

        <h2>CHOOSE EASY-TO-CLEND BEDDING</h2>

        <p>Not all bedding has the same function. Certain fabrics for blankets and sheets absorb sweat and dust easily, leaving your bed full of dust. It is also a suitable place to breed dust mites.</p>

        <p>The best products available today are those that are designed not only to be absorbent but also to have an effective dirt-removal feature. You can choose for your family the bedding products of Song Hong brand to get comfort and peace of mind about health and safety in the best way.</p>

        <p>You should choose bedding and bed sheets made from materials that help antibacterial and antifungal, as well as good air circulation. Materials such as cotton, silk, and brocade should be given top priority. They are not only durable over the years but also extremely safe for the health of the user. Antibacterial bedding with good ventilation will help protect you more effectively, and longer against germs, in addition, it is also beneficial for people with allergies.</p>
        <p>It is recommended to use a mattress with a 2-3-piece folding design that is easy to fold, easy to transport, convenient to store, and clean.</p>
        <p>Besides paying attention to easy-to-clean bedding, you should also choose a bed shelf that's convenient for cleaning. The Divan Dunlopillo bed shelf is designed with four wheels at four corners for easy movement and cleaning. It will be much more convenient if you use a Divan shelf instead of a traditional bed.</p>
        <p>Each time you clean, you just need to move the shelf to a spacious, well-lit place and remove the mattress to clean.</p>
